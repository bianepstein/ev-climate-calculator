# EV climate impact calculator

This is a javascript based calculator for estimating EV climate impact compared.

It is a one page calculatur based on public available information.

## How to use
It should be fairly trivial to integrate into a web page.
The calculator only depends on jQuery.
Link it after jQuery and have a single div with the id "ev-canvas".
That should be it.
